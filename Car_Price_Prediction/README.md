## Description

This project focuses on predicting car prices based on various features like mileage, engine power, manufacturer, fuel type, transmission, and owner type. It utilizes machine learning techniques, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, and both Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression models to make accurate predictions.

## Overview

The Car Price Prediction project aims to analyze and predict car prices using a dataset that includes information on different car models and their specifications. The project includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the relationships between different features and car prices. Through one-hot encoding and standardization, the data is prepared for machine learning models. The project then trains both Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression models to make predictions, evaluating their performance using the R-squared score.
